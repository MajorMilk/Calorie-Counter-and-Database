# Calorie-Counter-and-Database

## Huge update!
Just got done with the WPF Port / remake. Works essentially the same but has a much better UI and adds the ability to Save Meals and food items independantly.
I still havent gotten around to the data analysis tool, but that will come next.

### Usage

Everything starts at the home From it you can add new meals, or edit existing ones or load / save them.

Start by adding a meal, then click on it. From there you'll be able to press the edit meal button.

From the edit meal screen, start by entering the information about your food item in the appropriate slots, then press add (or save) food. All files for this program are saved as
