# Calorie-Counter-and-Database

I am currently in the process of updating this to a WPF app with a more modern UI. Datastorage will be handled the same way, so as long
as you're currently using the newly implemented .xml format for your days of food, all data will be portable.

 Program functionality is pretty limited at the moment, however I have plans to update this with some kind of data analysis tool that will allow you to compare your last week of activity compared to some goal. I also plan to add more variables to the food item class to add nutrition facts.
 
 To use the program:
  -Add a meal with the add meal button
  
  -Put the number of that meal in the text box next to the edit meal button (1)
  
  -When the new form opens, press the Add Food button and enter the data requested
  
  -if you had more than one of that foor item, put the number ascociated in the text box (1 if its the only one) then click the Add One Food item, or Remove one, depending on what you want.
  
Thats it

To look back upon previous data, simply click a new date on the calendar.
